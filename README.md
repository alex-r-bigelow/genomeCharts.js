genomeCharts.js
===============

d3.js code I used to create figures for a paper;
I'm posting it here in case someone finds it useful
(code is in genomeCharts.js, examples are in figure1.html
and figure2.html, and styling is in style.css).

Implemented charts are meant to be lined up vertically,
genome-browser style. Charts include scatterplots, histograms,
gantt charts, and, of course, a gene view. Multiple genomic ranges
can be specified (see figure2.html for an example). A canvas-based
coverage plot is also included (though I probably should have
done this as a normal histogram).
