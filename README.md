genomeCharts.js
===============

d3.js code I used to create figures for a paper;
I'm posting it here in case someone finds it useful.

Implemented charts are meant to be lined up horizontally,
genome-browser style. Charts include scatterplots, histograms,
gantt charts, and, of course, a gene view. Multiple genomic ranges
can be specified (see figure2.html for an example). A canvas-based
coverage plot is also included (though I probably should have
done this as a normal histogram).
