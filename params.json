Charts include scatterplots, histograms,\r\ngantt charts, and, of course, a gene view. Multiple genomic ranges\r\ncan be specified (see figure2.html for an example). A canvas-based\r\ncoverage plot is also included (though I probably should have\r\ndone this as a normal histogram).\r\n\r\nLicense: MIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
